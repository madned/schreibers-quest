# Supper Wedding Adventure

###The game
**Supper Weddig Adventure** is a graphic adventure made in Impact JS that we did for our wedding. In the game the player needs to find several clues to find all the necessary information to attend to the wedding.

###Technical Info
The game uses **ImpactJS** engine and also **Impact Plus Plus**. The engine is not free but the result is quite good, works in major browsers, is easy to learn and the lisence is relativly cheap. 

We had to develop a **i18n system** (text and images) to localize the game to 3 different languages, as long with some other minor changes and improvements. We did this a little bit in a rush, so any improvement will be more than welcomed. Enjoy!

Also I've included the PSD files, in case someone wants to modify some of the images.

####How to run it
Include impact library on the lib folder. Bake with Impact tools and enjoy!
